      |  explores themes of eternity, metamorphosis, and infinite movement which he achieved by playing with perspective, patterns, and tessellation. As an intuitive mathematician, he discovered these systems himself through experimentation.

    p Escher achieves “infinity” in his work with repeating patterns — shapes along planes on a flat surface, also called plane tessellations. A plane tessellation is an infinite set of shapes fitting together to cover the whole plane once, with no overlaps and no gaps.
      sup 2 
      | Tesselations are found in nature, like in the hexagonal cells of honeycombs and in crystals.
      sup 3 
      | Nature is also a strong theme in Escher's work.
    p He saw tessellation as his most important theme, as 
      i “the richest source of inspiration” 
      | that he had ever tapped.
